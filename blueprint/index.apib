# Purpose

[The Grid](https://thegrid.io/) is a next-generation web publishing platform.
The service provides a complete user experience for making, editing content
across multiple devices, but also has a complete API available.
This document describes that API and how it can be used by developers, including third-party.

Functionality provided includes

* Web page auto-design, layout and publishing
* Content import and analysis
* Image processing
* Handling payments (TDB)

What The Grid is not.

Not a web-hosting platform to run arbitrary PHP/Python/Ruby or databases on.

# Access

API access is available to all users on The Grid.

on your [accounts page](https://passport.thegrid.io/)
